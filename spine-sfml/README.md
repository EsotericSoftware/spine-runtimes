# spine-sfml

The spine-sfml runtime provides functionality to load, manipulate and render [Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com) skeletal animation data using [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/). spine-sfml is based on [spine-c](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/tree/master/spine-c).

## Setup

1. Download the Spine Runtimes source using [git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) or by downloading it [as a zip](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/archive/master.zip).
1. Using Eclipse CDT, import the project by choosing File -> Import -> Existing projects. For other IDEs you will need to create a new project and import the source.
1. Copy the SFML binaries into the `spine-sfml/Debug` directory so they can be found when the example is run.

Alternatively, the contents of the `spine-c/src`, `spine-c/include` and `spine-sfml/src` directories can be copied into your project. Be sure your header search path will find the contents of the `spine-c/include` and `spine-sfml/src` directories. Note that the includes use `spine/Xxx.h`, so the `spine` directory cannot be omitted when copying the files.
