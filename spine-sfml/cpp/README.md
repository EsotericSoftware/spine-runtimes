# spine-sfml

The spine-sfml runtime provides functionality to load, manipulate and render [Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com) skeletal animation data using [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/). spine-sfml is based on [spine-cpp](../../spine-cpp).

## Licensing
You are welcome to evaluate the Spine Runtimes and the examples we provide in this repository free of charge.

You can integrate the Spine Runtimes into your software free of charge, but users of your software must have their own [Spine license](https://esotericsoftware.com/spine-purchase). Please make your users aware of this requirement! This option is often chosen by those making development tools, such as an SDK, game toolkit, or software library.

In order to distribute your software containing the Spine Runtimes to others that don't have a Spine license, you need a [Spine license](https://esotericsoftware.com/spine-purchase) at the time of integration. Then you can distribute your software containing the Spine Runtimes however you like, provided others don't modify it or use it to create new software. If others want to do that, they'll need their own Spine license.

For the official legal terms governing the Spine Runtimes, please read the [Spine Runtimes License Agreement](http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-runtimes-license) and Section 2 of the [Spine Editor License Agreement](http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-editor-license#s2).

## Spine version

spine-sfml works with data exported from Spine 3.8.xx.

spine-sfml supports all Spine features except two color tinting.

## Usage
1. Create a new SFML project. See the [SFML documentation](http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/) or have a look at the example in this repository.
2. Download the Spine Runtimes source using git (`git clone https://github.com/esotericsoftware/spine-runtimes`) or download it as a zip via the download button above.
3. Add the sources from `spine-cpp/spine-cpp/src/spine` and `spine-sfml/src/spine` to your project
4. Add the folder `spine-cpp/spine-cpp/include` to your header search path. Note that includes are specified as `#inclue <spine/file.h>`, so the `spine` directory cannot be omitted when copying the source files.

See the [Spine Runtimes documentation](http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-documentation#runtimesTitle) on how to use the APIs or check out the Spine SFML example.

## Example
The Spine SFML example works on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

### Windows
1. Install [Visual Studio 2015 Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx). Make sure you install support for C++ as well as th Windows SDK for XP/7/8.
2. Install CMake via the [Windows installer package](https://cmake.org/download/).
3. Download the Spine Runtimes repository using git (`git clone https://github.com/esotericsoftware/spine-runtimes`) or download it as a zip via the download button above.
4. Run CMake GUI from the start menu
5. Click `Browse Source` and select the directory `spine-runtimes`
6. Click `Browse Build` and select the `spine-runtimes/spine-sfml/build` directory. You can create the `build` folder directly in the file dialog via `New Folder`.
7. Click `Configure`. Then click `Generate`. This will create a Visual Studio 2015 solution file called `spine.sln` in `spine-runtimes/spine-sfml/build` and also download the SFML dependencies.
8. Open the `spine.sln` file in Visual Studio 2015
9. Right click the `spine-sfml-example` project in the solution explorer and select `Set as Startup Project` from the context menu
10. Right click the `spine-sfml-example` project in the solution explorer and select `Properties` from the context menu
11. Select `Debugging` in the left-hand list, then set `Working Directory` to `$(OutputPath)`
12. Click `Local Windows Debugger` to run the example

The entire example code is contained in [main.cpp](example/main.cpp)

### Linux
1. Install the SFML dependencies, e.g. on Ubuntu/Debian via `sudo apt install libsfml-dev`
2. Install CMake, e.g. on Ubuntu/Debian via `sudo apt-get install -y cmake`
3. Download the Spine Runtimes repository using git (`git clone https://github.com/esotericsoftware/spine-runtimes`) or download it as a zip via the download button above.
4. Open a terminal, and `cd` into the `spine-runtimes/spine-sfml` folder
5. Type `mkdir build && cd build && cmake ../..` to generate Make files
6. Type `make` to compile the example
7. Run the example by `cd spine-sfml && ./spine-sfml-example`

### Mac OS X
1. Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
2. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
3. Open a terminal and install CMake via `brew install cmake`
3. Download the Spine Runtimes repository using git (`git clone https://github.com/esotericsoftware/spine-runtimes`) or download it as a zip via the download button above.
4. Open a terminal, and `cd` into the `spine-runtimes/spine-sfml` folder
5. Type `mkdir build && cd build && cmake -G Xcode ../..` to generate an Xcode project called `spine.xcodeproj`
6. Open the Xcode project in `spine-runtimes/spine-sfml/build/`
7. In Xcode, set the active scheme from `ALL_BUILD` to `spine-sfml-example`
8. Click the `Run` button or type `CMD+R` to run the example
