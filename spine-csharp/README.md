# spine-csharp

The spine-csharp runtime provides functionality to load and manipulate [Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com) skeletal animation data using C# (C Sharp). It does not perform rendering but can be extended to enable Spine animations for other C#-based projects.

## Setup

1. Download the Spine Runtimes source using [git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) or by downloading it [as a zip](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/archive/master.zip).
1. Open the `spine-csharp.sln` Visual C# 2010 Express project file.

Alternatively, the contents of the `spine-csharp/src` directory can be copied into your project.
