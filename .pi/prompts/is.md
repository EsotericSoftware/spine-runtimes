Analyze GitHub issue(s): $ARGUMENTS

For each issue:

1. Read the issue in full, including all comments and linked issues/PRs.
2. Do not trust analysis written in the issue. Independently verify behavior and derive your own analysis from the code and execution path.

3. **For bugs**:
   - Ignore any root cause analysis in the issue (likely wrong).
   - Read all related code files in full (no truncation).
   - Trace the code path and identify the actual root cause.
   - Propose a fix and list affected runtime directories/files.

4. **For feature requests**:
   - Do not trust implementation proposals in the issue without verification.
   - Read all related code files in full (no truncation).
   - Propose the most concise implementation approach.
   - List affected files and runtime directories.

Do NOT implement unless explicitly asked. Analyze and propose only.
