# spine-godot

The spine-godot runtime provides functionality to load, manipulate and render [Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com) skeletal animation data using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). spine-godot is based on [spine-cpp](../spine-cpp).

## Licensing

You are welcome to evaluate the Spine Runtimes and the examples we provide in this repository free of charge.

You can integrate the Spine Runtimes into your software free of charge, but users of your software must have their own [Spine license](https://esotericsoftware.com/spine-purchase). Please make your users aware of this requirement! This option is often chosen by those making development tools, such as an SDK, game toolkit, or software library.

In order to distribute your software containing the Spine Runtimes to others that don't have a Spine license, you need a [Spine license](https://esotericsoftware.com/spine-purchase) at the time of integration. Then you can distribute your software containing the Spine Runtimes however you like, provided others don't modify it or use it to create new software. If others want to do that, they'll need their own Spine license.

For the official legal terms governing the Spine Runtimes, please read the [Spine Runtimes License Agreement](http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-runtimes-license) and Section 2 of the [Spine Editor License Agreement](http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-editor-license#s2).

## Spine version

spine-godot works with data exported from Spine 4.0.xx.

spine-godot supports all Spine features.

## Setup

spine-godot works with the latest stable Godot 3.3 release. It requires compilation of Godot, as spine-godot is implemented as a module.

To integrate spine-godot into your project:

1. Follow the [instructions on how to compilation of Godot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/development/compiling/index.html)
2. Copy the `spine-runtimes/spine-godot/spine_godot` folder into the folder `modules/spine_godot` in your Godot source tree.
3. Copy the `spine-cpp/spine-cpp`folder into the folder `modules/spine_godot/spine-cpp` in your Godot source tree.
4. Compile Godot via scons for your platform as per the Godot documentation.

The resulting Godot engine binary will include the spine-godot runtime.

## Example
The Spine Godot example work on all platforms supported by Godot.
