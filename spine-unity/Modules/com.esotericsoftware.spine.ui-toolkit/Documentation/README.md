## Spine UI Toolkit Extension [Experimental]

This experimental plugin provides integration of UI Toolkit for the spine-unity runtime. Please be sure to test this package first and create backups of your project before using.
The plugin adds a `SpineVisualElement` control element to be used with UI Toolkit, providing functionality similar to `SkeletonGraphic` to add your Spine skeletons to a Visual Tree Asset via UI Toolkit's UI Builder.

### Usage

For usage of the `SpineVisualElement` control element, you can check out the included `UI Toolkit Example.unity` example scene and `SpineUIToolkit.uxml` file which can be installed via the `Samples` tab in the Unity Package Manager window.
The new `SpineVisualElement` can be found in the Unity `UI Builder` window under `Library - Project - Custom Controls` `Spine - Unity - SpineVisualElement`. It can be added to your hierarchy and configured as normal UI Toolkit elements while providing Spine skeleton attributes as well.
