AnimationMatchModifierAsset
===========================

This is a SkeletonDataModifierAsset. Add it to a SkeletonDataAsset to apply its effects when its SkeletonData is loaded.

AnimationMatchModifierAsset processes animations so that their timelines match. This allows them to function with naive Animation Apply systems such as SkeletonMecanim without the need for autoreset functionality.
