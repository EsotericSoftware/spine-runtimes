			// STEP 1.1 Find the original attachment.
			// Step 1.2 Get a clone of the original attachment.
			// Step 1.3 Apply the Sprite image to it.
			// Step 1.4 Add the remapped clone to the new custom skin.

			// Let's do this for the visor.

			// a cached Texture copy which can be cleared by calling AtlasUtilities.ClearCache() as done below.
			Attachment newAttachment = baseAttachment.GetRemappedClone(visorSprite, sourceMaterial); // STEP 1.2 - 1.3
			customSkin.SetAttachment(visorSlotIndex, visorKey, newAttachment); // STEP 1.4

			// STEP 3: APPLY AND CLEAN UP.
			// Recommended: REPACK THE CUSTOM SKIN TO MINIMIZE DRAW CALLS
			// 				Repacking requires that you set all source textures/sprites/atlases to be Read/Write enabled in the inspector.
