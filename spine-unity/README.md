# spine-unity

The **spine-unity** runtime provides functionality to load, manipulate and render [Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com) skeletal animation data using [Unity](http://unity3d.com/). spine-unity is based on [spine-csharp](../spine-csharp).

For more documentation, see [spine-unity Documentation](http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-unity).

While spine-unity can render directly with Unity, without the need for any other plugins, it also works with [2D Toolkit](http://www.2dtoolkit.com/) and can render skeletons using a TK2D texture atlas.

## Licensing

You are welcome to evaluate the Spine Runtimes and the examples we provide in this repository free of charge.

You can integrate the Spine Runtimes into your software free of charge, but users of your software must have their own [Spine license](https://esotericsoftware.com/spine-purchase). Please make your users aware of this requirement! This option is often chosen by those making development tools, such as an SDK, game toolkit, or software library.

In order to distribute your software containing the Spine Runtimes to others that don't have a Spine license, you need a [Spine license](https://esotericsoftware.com/spine-purchase) at the time of integration. Then you can distribute your software containing the Spine Runtimes however you like, provided others don't modify it or use it to create new software. If others want to do that, they'll need their own Spine license.

For the official legal terms governing the Spine Runtimes, please read the [Spine Runtimes License Agreement](http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-runtimes-license) and Section 2 of the [Spine Editor License Agreement](http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-editor-license#s2).

## Spine version

spine-unity works with data exported from Spine 3.8.xx.

spine-unity supports all Spine features.

Unity's physics components do not support dynamically assigned vertices so they cannot be used to mirror bone-weighted and deformed BoundingBoxAttachments. However, BoundingBoxAttachment vertices at runtime will still deform correctly and can be used to perform manual hit detection.

## Documentation

A Spine skeleton GameObject (a GameObject with a SkeletonAnimation component on it) can be used throughout Unity like any other GameObject. It renders through `MeshRenderer`.

See [spine-unity Documentation](http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-unity).

## Quick installation

Download the latest Spine-Unity unitypackage from the download page: http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-unity-download/

In the `Assets/Spine Examples/Scenes` folder you will find many example scenes that demonstrate various spine-unity features.

## Notes

- This slightly outdated [spine-unity tutorial video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1umSQulghA) may still be useful.
- Atlas images should use **Premultiplied Alpha** when using the shaders that come with spine-unity (`Spine/Skeleton` or `Spine/SkeletonLit`).
- Texture artifacts from compression: Unity's 2D project defaults import new images added to the project with the Texture Type "Sprite". This can cause artifacts when using the `Spine/Skeleton` shader. To avoid these artifacts, make sure the Texture Type is set to "Texture". spine-unity's automatic import will attempt to apply these settings but in the process of updating your textures, these settings may be reverted.
