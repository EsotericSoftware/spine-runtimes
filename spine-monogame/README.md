# spine-monogame

The spine-monogame runtime provides functionality to load, manipulate and render [Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com) skeletal animation data using [MonoGame](http://monogame.codeplex.com/). spine-monogame is based on [spine-xna](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/tree/master/spine-xna) and adds MonoGame project files.

## Setup

1. Download the Spine Runtimes source using [git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) or by downloading it [as a zip](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/archive/master.zip).
1. Open the Windows 8 Store or Xamarin Studio project files in `spine-monogame`.

Alternatively, the contents of the `spine-csharp/src` and `spine-xna/src` directories can be copied into your project.
