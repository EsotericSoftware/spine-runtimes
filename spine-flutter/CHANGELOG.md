# 4.2.21

- FilterQuality for texture atlas pages is now set to medium. It is configurable via `Atlas.filterQuality`. See https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/issues/2362
- Track Entry listeners are now invoked properly, see https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/issues/2349

# 4.2.20

- Fixed clipping bug, see https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/issues/2431

# 4.2.19

- Fixes #2412, single bone, translation only IK constraints did not take skeleton scale into account.

# 4.2.18

- Fixes compilation errors due to API change in Flutter 3.16.0, see [this issue](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/issues/2420). **Note**: Depending on this version requires your project to depend on Flutter >= 3.16.0 as well.

# 4.1.14

- Temporary "fix" for https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/issues/2479. It appears the canvaskit backend of Flutter has a bug. We currently do not set a `FilterQuality` anymore. The Flutter rendering backend is supposed to pick a good one depending the platform. Users can still set `FilterQuality` globally via `Atlas.filterQuality` as before.
