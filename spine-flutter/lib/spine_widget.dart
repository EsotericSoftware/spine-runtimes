/// Upon initialization of a [SpineWidget] the provided [onInitialized] callback method is called once. This method can be used
/// to setup the initial animation(s) of the skeleton, among other things.
///
/// After initialization is complete, the [SpineWidget] is rendered at the screen refresh rate. In each frame,
/// the [AnimationState] is updated and applied to the [Skeleton].
///
/// Next the optionally provided method [onBeforeUpdateWorldTransforms] is called, which can modify the
/// skeleton before its current pose is calculated using [Skeleton.updateWorldTransforms]. After
/// [Skeleton.updateWorldTransforms] has completed, the optional [onAfterUpdateWorldTransforms] method is
/// called, which can modify the current pose before rendering the skeleton.
///
/// Before the skeleton's current pose is rendered by the [SpineWidget] the optional [onBeforePaint] is called,
/// which allows rendering backgrounds or other objects that should go behind the skeleton on the [Canvas]. The
/// [SpineWidget] then renderes the skeleton's current pose, and finally calls the optional [onAfterPaint], which
/// can render additional objects on top of the skeleton.
///
/// The underlying [Atlas], [SkeletonData], [Skeleton], [AnimationStateData], [AnimationState], and [SkeletonDrawable]
/// can be accessed through their respective getters to inspect and/or modify the skeleton and its associated data. Accessing
/// this data is only allowed if the [SpineWidget] and its data have been initialized and have not been disposed yet.

/// and rendering the skeleton. The [resume] method resumes updating and rendering the skeleton. The [isPlaying] getter
